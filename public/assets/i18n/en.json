The application uses a Firebase Realtime Database, allowing tasks and contacts to be managed in real time across devices. The project demonstrated just how crucial strong team dynamics are when building complex applications."

        "implDetails": "The project was implemented using object-oriented programming in JavaScript, separating moveable objects, drawable objects, levels, and audio into clearly defined components. The main challenge was to ensure smooth animations while keeping track of all time-based processes such as intervals and timeouts. Each movement and process was decoupled so they would not interfere with one another. In addition, fitting music and sound effects were tied directly to specific game events. This structure not only resulted in clean code but also provided valuable experience in coordinating animation, timing, and audio."

We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p> <p>When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p> <p>We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>\n<br><h3>Information about the Controller</h3> <p>The Controller responsible for data processing on this website is:</p> <p>Alexander Ruppel<br />\nNiehörsterstr. 13<br />\n33104 Paderborn</p>\n\n<p>Phone: 017622393181<br />\nE-mail: a.ruppel1@icloud.com</p>\n <p>The controller is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>\n\n<br><h3>Storage duration</h3> <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>\n<br><h3>General information on the legal bases of data processing on this website</h3> <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and, where special categories of data pursuant to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed, on the basis of Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR. In the event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR.

We also process your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The respective legal basis applicable in each individual case is explained in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>\n<br><h3>Recipients of personal data</h3> <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This sometimes also requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data if this is necessary for the performance of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g. transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in the transfer or if another legal basis permits the transfer of data. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid data processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint controllership agreement is concluded.</p>\n<br><h3>Withdrawal of your consent to data processing</h3> <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>\n<br><h3>Right to object to data collection in specific cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3> <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME, ON GROUNDS RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, INCLUDING PROFILING BASED ON THOSE PROVISIONS. THE APPLICABLE LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING IS SET OUT IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p> <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING, WHICH INCLUDES PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>\n<br><h3>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</h3> <p>In the event of infringements of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>\n<br><h3>Right to data portability</h3> <p>You have the right to have data which we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>\n<br><h3>Access, rectification and erasure</h3> <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to obtain information free of charge about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to rectification or erasure of this data.

For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li> <li>If the processing of your personal data was/ is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.</li> <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.</li> <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li> </ul> <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or of a Member State.</p>\n<br><h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3> <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator.
